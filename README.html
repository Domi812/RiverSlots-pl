<p>This repo contains Island Files to integrate River Slots and accompanying River Slot Buildings like those found in Enbesa to all Old and New World Islands.</p>
<p>If you like this mod and want to support me, feel free to share it with your friends. You can also buy me a coffee at Ko-Fi (yes, I want to raise my coffee consume to Investor's height!)</p>

<ul>
<li>Either use <a href="https://github.com/anno-mods/iModYourAnno/releases">iModYourAnno</a> mod manager or know <a href="https://github.com/jakobharder/anno1800-mod-loader#mods">how to install mods manually</a>.</li>
<li>If you download the mod manually, use the archieve from <a href="https://github.com/Taludas/RiverSlots/releases">GitHub releases</a>. Don't download the whole repo!</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>This mod REQUIRES a new savegame! Otherwise the islands will show no river slots.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Due to the enourmos size of the island files, the mod consists of four zip files!</strong><br>
Please download all files to get the intended full experience. You could also choose to install only pairs of file, making the river slots available in the respective region.</p>

<h3 id="riverslots-1">Riverslots</h3>
<p>On each island you can now find a varying number of riverslots (from 1 on the medium islands up to 10 on CF). These work exactly like the ones found in Enbesa. Slot buildings can be connected via both sides of the river slot. Since the UI is hardcoded, we unfortunately can't provide a nice interface to build buildings on the slot directly, you have to select them from the build menu.</p>
<p>This mod is mostly relevant as a modders ressource, providing the necessary island files to start a project with your own river slot buildings. So everyone feel free to include this in your own mod as a dependence via modinfo.json file. Due to the enourmous size of the mods I wouldn't recommend on providing them as a subfolder in your mod.</p>

<h3 id="riverslot-buildings-ow">Riverslot Buildings OW</h3>
<p>This Mod features five new buildings fitting for the newly introduced river slots in the Old World. They all produce vanilla goods at a sligthly faster rate than their non river counterparts. The River Powerplant has the same range as the vanilla Oil Powerplant. You can either find the buildings inside their respective production chains, a separate building category or directly next to the vanilla building.</p>
<p>Following buildings are available for River Slot construction:</p>
<ul>
<li>River Fishery (50 Farmers)</li>
<li>River Clay Collector (1 Worker)</li>
<li>River Sawmill (1 Artisan)</li>
<li>River Flour Mill (1 Artisan)</li>
<li>River Powerplant (1 Engineer)</li>
</ul>
<p>You can use iMYA to tweak which buildings you would like to play with.</p>

<h2 id="special-thanks">Special Thanks</h2>
<p>Thank you to Taubenangriff for providing River Slot Locations for the five vanilla NW large islands and the 6 vanilla medium islands. He had the original idea behind this mod way back in the early days of the New Horizons Project, but since the addition of River Slots is quite tedious, I jumped in and found suitable locations for all the Old World islands as well as the newly added New World islands after DLC12.</p>
