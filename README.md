This repo contains Island Files to integrate River Slots and accompanying River Slot Buildings like those found in Enbesa to all Old and New World Islands.

## How to use

- Be sure how to use either the [iModYourAnno Anno Mod Manager](https://github.com/anno-mods/iModYourAnno) or the ingame modloader directly after GU17.
- download the mod archieve from [GitHub releases](https://github.com/Taludas/RiverSlots/releases)


**This mod REQUIRES a new savegame! Otherwise the islands will show no river slots.**  

**Due to the enourmos size of the island files, the mod consists of two zip files!**  
Please download both files to get the intended full experience. You could also choose to install only one file, making the river slots available in the respective region.

### Riverslots
On each island you can now find a varying number of riverslots (from 1 on the medium islands up to 10 on CF). These work exactly like the ones found in Enbesa. Slot buildings can be connected via both sides of the river slot. Since the UI is hardcoded, we unfortunately can't provide a nice interface to build buildings on the slot directly, you have to select them from the build menu.

This mod is mostly relevant as a modders ressource, providing the necessary island files to start a project with your own river slot buildings. So everyone feel free to include this in your own mod as a dependence via modinfo.json file. Due to the enourmous size of the mods I wouldn't recommend on providing them as a subfolder in your mod.
